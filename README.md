## About
I am a long time management consultant with a lot of nerd hobbies, including programming. I have a side hustle working with
very small wine and liquor retailers (mom & pop's) helping them leverage eCommerce, business intellegence, and analytics (winefoundry.com)
that gives my hobby a bit of focus. Having real retail problems to work on gives my programming something to focus on.
